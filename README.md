# DataScraper
A data scraper created to scrape the data from Final Fantasy XIV Lodestone.  
The data being scraped was mainly to retreive character data for a specified free company to organise raids 
or request for items or minerals. 

The data was written to a csv which was imported into a document to display all party job levels.

This is still a work in progress, and has not yet been change to a generic structure.
Current support jsoup jar has been added.
